# The Unfancy Remote

A cheap, open, modular and reliable DIY remote with a focus on RF performance. 

**WARNING** : The software and CAD files included in this repo are in a **BETA STAGE** at the moment and **SHOULD BE USED CAREFULLY**. I am not responsible for **ANY** injures or damages you may incur as a result of using the HW or SW described in this project.

# Design considerations

* Unfancy. I use other devices for my telemetry, so no UART (even though could be easily added in the future) or OLED screens. PPM for the win.
* DIY friendly and modular. 
* Stellar RF performance is a must. The whole idea for this project came after in the FPV drone space [this project](https://www.expresslrs.org/2.0/) became super popular. It uses LoRa transcievers to achieve great range and link speeds, using a proprietary modulation that is specially robust against interference. It can also work on 433MHz/868MHz/2.4GHz bands depending on the specific module.
* Multiple shells to accomodate thumbwheels, triggers, Qi charging, battery sizes...
* Community driven

# Building the code

It has been tested on the latest (at the time of writing, 1.8.19) Arduino IDE version, using the fantastic [SX12XX Library](https://github.com/StuartsProjects/SX12XX-LoRa) by StuartsProjects.
