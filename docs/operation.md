# Operating the remote

Once assembled, configured with pairing information and connected, the remote should be configurable as any other PPM remote via the VESC tool. 

## Turning it on/off

To turn the remote on, press the button until it rumbles and ***ALL*** four LEDs turn on. Once they're all on, release the button. To turn it off, press the button for at least 5 seconds until it starts to rumble continuosly. Release the button and it should turn off.

## Working modes

The remote has two modes that can be toggled by briefly pressing the button with the remote turned on. It starts by default in mode 1.

* Mode 1: Show board battery level.
* Mode 2: Show remote battery level.

When switching modes, the remote will vibrate quickly to indicate what mode you have moved to. If in mode 1, press the button for at least 250ms and you'll feel 2 short vibrations. You're now on mode 2. If in mode 2, press the button and you'll feel 1 short vibration. You're now on mode 1 again.

## Calibration mode

If you have to repeat the hall sensor calibration follow these steps:

* Make sure the remote is OFF.
* Press the button to turn it ON, but don't release it until it stops vibrating on its own and the first LED turns ON. 
* Now follow the [calibration procedure](./software.md#calibration)
